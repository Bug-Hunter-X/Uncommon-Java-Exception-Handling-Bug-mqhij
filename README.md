This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates an uncommon error related to exception handling. The program intentionally divides by zero, catches the ArithmeticException, and then re-throws the exception without adding any additional context.  This makes debugging more challenging as the original stack trace is not enhanced with extra information on where the exception was initially caught. The solution shows how to improve this scenario.
